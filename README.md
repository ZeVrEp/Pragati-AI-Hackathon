# Repo for Pragati-AI-Hackathon

What This Repo Contains

This repository includes **basic prototypes** of three core AI-driven services:
1. **FIBIL Score Calculator** – An alternative to CIBIL, designed specifically for farmers, considering 10+ relevant agri-economic parameters.
2. **Crop Insurance Risk Advisor** – Helps farmers understand their crop risk based on yield forecast, climate, and soil conditions.
3. **Financial Planning Assistant** – Offers tailored savings/investment advice based on the farmer's income, expenses, goals, and resources.

These modules are implemented using **Google Gemini** via prompt engineering and are executed in a lightweight, low-code approach on **Google Colab**.

## Tech Stack

- Python (LangChain, Google Generative AI SDK)
- Gemini Pro (for prompt-based AI)
- Google Colab (runtime)
- [Planned] Zephyr (Open Source LLM) for offline deployment
- [Planned] Multilingual chatbot frontend (UI under development)

---

##  Important Notes

- This is a **minimal working prototype** focused on backend intelligence logic only.
- The **final production-ready version** with:
  - Open-source LLM (Zephyr) instead of Gemini,
  - Multilingual UI (chatbot interface),
  - Offline support & mobile-first deployment,
  is **currently under development** and will be released in upcoming versions.
